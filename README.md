# MTCFeatures

The [Meertens Tune Collections](http://www.liederenbank.nl/mtc/) provides various data sets with melodic data. The melodies are provided in Humdrum **kern encoding and as MIDI sequences. In many cases, a representation of the melodies as sequences of feature values is needed. `MTCFeatureLoader` is a Python module that provides such feature sequences together with functionality for feature and object filtering and feature extraction.
