# MTCFeatures

The [Meertens Tune Collections](http://www.liederenbank.nl/mtc/) include various data sets with melodic data. The melodies are provided in Humdrum **kern encoding and as MIDI sequences. In many cases, a representation of the melodies as sequences of feature values is needed rather than encoded scores.

MTCFeatures is a Python module that provides melodic data sets containing such feature sequences, and functionality for feature and object filtering and feature extraction.

The following data sets are included:

* MTC-ANN-2.0.1 - A small set of 360 richly annotated melodies from Dutch sources.
* MTC-FS-INST-2.0 - A large set of c. 18 thousand melodies from Dutch sources.
* ESSEN Folksong Collection - A set of over 8 thousand folk song melodies mainly from Germany.

Further documentation is available at https://pvankranenburg.github.io/MTCFeatures, or in the ./docs directory.
